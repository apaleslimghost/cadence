# todo

- [x] cells ui
- [x] parsing and running exprs in cells
- [x] reactive cell references
- [x] primitives for generating and processing observables
- [x] visual cell ui
  - [ ] automerge?
  - [ ] collab?
  - [ ] controls
  - [x] audionode oscilloscopes
  - [x] data persistence
  - [x] observable update flashing
  - [x] observable values
- [ ] more tonejs wrappers/primitives
  - [x] samples
    - [ ] strudel banks
  - [ ] jux rev (thanks yaxu)
  - [x] synth params
  - [ ] more synths
  - [ ] supersaw!
  - [x] oscs and filters
  - [x] effects
    - [ ] more effects
  - [x] transpose
  - [x] rests (null notes)
  - [x] LFOs/envelopes, connecting nodes to params not via observables 🤔
  - [x] easier .connect/.chain
  - [x] spreadsheet ranges for arrays
  - [ ] imports
  - [ ] euclid
  - [ ] more generic sequencer
    - [ ] drum pattern seq
    - [ ] chord/polyphonic seq
    - [ ] sequencing sequencers (switchMap)
- [ ] bugs/UI improvements
  - [x] stopping/restarting transport
  - [x] display pending observable value
  - [x] loop sync, quantisation etc
  - [x] split actual values in observable from displayed values in cell (hookable serialise)
  - [ ] flash cell on read(? is that even possible?)
  - [ ] indistinguishable between deleting a cell that returns a reference to something and deleting the cell containing the thing
  - [x] starting loops that were initialised before the transport started (should work? doesn't consistently eg on load with persistent data)
  - [x] need to unsubscribe/stop(?) when editing a cell or if its dependencies update, not just on delete
  - [x] deleting a synth stops a seq it's connected to
  - [ ] deleting a seq doesn't stop it
- [ ] midi
  - [ ] CCs
  - [ ] notes
    - [ ] computer keyboard cell type???
